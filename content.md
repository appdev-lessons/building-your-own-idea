Can you now identify a problem that can be solved with software and build something to test your theory?

Remember, [the verb you want to be using with respect to ideas is not "think up" but "notice".](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

The goal is for you to take a proof of concept — which is smaller than a minimum viable product — from a sketch all the way through deployment, and thereby witness firsthand at least one cycle of software development, and its constituent moving parts.
That's a lot to do, so keep the functionality to a minimum — Keep it simple. <!-- TODO: link to lesson -->

## Requirements

### Hard requirements
- It should solve a problem that you clearly articulate in a Functional Specification. <!-- TODO: link to lesson -->
- It should be interactive in some way; in other words, it should not just be an informational, static website. (Adding a "Contact Us" form to the bottom of a landing page is not sufficient interactivity.)

That's it. Due to the wide variety in the ideas that people come up with, those are the only hard requirements.

### Soft guidelines
Historically, the vast majority of final projects (like the vast majority of software that we use on a daily basis) have also fit the following pattern:

- You can interact with it through your browser.
- It uses a database to store information.
- It has some associations (one-to-many and/or many-to-many) between tables.
- It has sign-in/sign-out functionality to personalize the experience for each visitor.

In other words, standard CRUD applications.

In very rare cases, an idea might not need a database (perhaps it reads and stores all data using an external API) or it might not need sign-in/sign-out (perhaps you are the only user and it emails you a CSV every morning). If you have an idea like this, you should run it by me. If it's not static HTML and it solves a problem for you, I'll likely be happy with it. But, mostly, projects fit the pattern of standard CRUD applications; similar to the ones we've built together in class.

## Deliverables
Ultimately, you will submit:

- Screencast Demo Video
- Functional Specification
- GitHub Repository URL
- Deployed Project URL
- Presentation Slides

## Requests for Projects (RFP)
We created [https://rfp.dpi.dev/](https://rfp.dpi.dev/) to help closely align your project with industry trends and employer expectations. Please read through to get an idea for the types of projects we're looking for. I highly encourage you to build a project that fits within these categories (or similar). If not, please chat with an instructor or assistant and we can work something out.
